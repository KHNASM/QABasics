## What is QA Testing?

**Quality Assurance (QA) Testing** ensures that software meets specified requirements and is free of defects. It involves:
- Detecting bugs.
- Verifying functionality.
- Ensuring a smooth user experience.

---

## Types of QA Testing

### 1. **Manual Testing**
Testing without automation tools. Testers manually execute test cases.
- Example: Checking if a login form accepts valid credentials.

### 2. **Automated Testing**
Using tools to automate repetitive tasks.
- Example: Automating login testing with Selenium.

### 3. **Functional Testing**
Verifies specific features work as expected.
- Example: Ensuring a "Buy Now" button redirects correctly.

### 4. **Non-Functional Testing**
Evaluates performance, usability, reliability, etc.
- Example: Load testing a website for 1,000 concurrent users.

### 5. **Regression Testing**
Ensures new updates don't break existing functionality.

## The QA Testing Process

1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Understand what the software should do.
2. **Test Planning**
   - Create a plan: scope, tools, schedule.
3. **Test Case Development**
   - Write detailed test cases.
4. **Environment Setup**
   - Prepare the system for testing.
5. **Test Execution**
   - Run tests and record results.
6. **Defect Reporting**
   - Log bugs with steps to reproduce.
7. **Test Closure**
   - Finalize and document testing efforts.

## Test Case Writing

**Test Case**: A detailed document outlining testing steps.

| Field         | Example                          |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Test Case ID  | TC001                            |
| Title         | Verify login functionality       |
| Steps         | 1. Open login page               |
|               | 2. Enter valid credentials       |
|               | 3. Click "Login"                |
| Expected Result | User is redirected to dashboard |

---

## Practical Examples

### 1. **Manual Testing Example**
**Scenario**: Testing a search feature.
- Steps:
  1. Open the website.
  2. Enter "QA Testing" in the search bar.
  3. Click the search button.
- Expected Result: Search results for "QA Testing" are displayed.

### 2. **Automated Testing Example**
**Scenario**: Automating login testing.
- Tool: Selenium
- Code Snippet (Python):

```python
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://example.com/login")

driver.find_element("id", "username").send_keys("test_user")
driver.find_element("id", "password").send_keys("password123")
driver.find_element("id", "login").click()

assert "Dashboard" in driver.title
driver.quit()
```

## Key Testing Concepts and Definitions

1. **Bug**: An error in the software.
2. **Test Case**: A set of actions to verify functionality.
3. **Test Plan**: A document detailing testing strategy.
4. **Smoke Testing**: A quick check to ensure critical functionality works.
5. **Performance Testing**: Evaluating the speed and scalability of software.
